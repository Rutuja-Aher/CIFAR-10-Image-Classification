## Overview

This project aims to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset using a CNN. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class. The classes are: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck.

## Dataset

The CIFAR-10 dataset is automatically downloaded by the code. It's split into training and testing sets. The training set contains 50,000 images, and the testing set contains 10,000 images.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cifar10-cnn.git
   cd cifar10-cnn
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Ensure you have activated your virtual environment (if created).

2. Train the CNN model using the following command:

   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

3. Evaluate the trained model on the test set:

   ```bash
   python evaluate.py
   ```

## Model Architecture

The CNN architecture used for this project is as follows:

```
TODO: Insert your CNN architecture diagram here
```

## Training

The model is trained using the training dataset. During training, data augmentation techniques such as random flips and crops are applied to improve generalization. The model is trained using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of X for Y epochs.

## Evaluation

The trained model is evaluated on the test dataset, and the following metrics are computed:

- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix

## Results

Our trained CNN achieved an accuracy of approximately Z% on the test dataset.
